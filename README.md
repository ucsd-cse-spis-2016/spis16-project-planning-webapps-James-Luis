# Brief Description

We plan to create a mind mapper. This could be a note-taking tool, brainstorming tool, planning tool, or anything that the user can think of using it for. Essentially, it would contain three basic elements: circles, lines, and arrows. The circles would contain the main ideas or topics. The lines/arrows would connect the circles together to represent that they are related in some way. Text can be added to describe these relationships. Ideas/topics can also branch off to represent separate subtopics. To make it more advanced, we can make tools that make creating and organizing mind maps more efficient, such as a button that would automatically organize and space out cluttered maps. 

# Stages

* Stage 1: Write some code that allows the user to input text into a circle diagram.
* Stage 2: Make multiple circles connect automatically.
* Stage 3: Allow user to drag circles around while having lines stay connected.
